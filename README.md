**CodePrimer**â€™s primary objective is to **allow software architects, business analysts and senior developers to define the data model and related processing from a business point of view** so that it can be easily understood and manipulated by entrepreneurs and business managers before starting the software development process. 

As such, it is meant to **prime** the software development process using simple, easy to use and effective representations that can be objectively interpreted by business and techies willing to cooperate to create digital businesses.

**CodePrimer** interprets this data model to **generate a set of artifacts (e.g. source code)** that are combined to **build a production-grade software solution following the architect's vision** to guide the development team to use his best practices.
 
The project offers an opinionated architecture, called [Business Bundle](doc/bundle/Overview.md) to get started. The resulting solution is meant to be highly scalable, yet requiring very low maintenance by leveraging the best DevOps practices with a minimal technical team.

It liberally borrows and integrates concepts and best practices that have been made available over the years by several movements in the software development space, such as UML, Domain-Driven Design (DDD), agile, micro services and DevOps. 

The resulting architecture and implementation is not meant to please everyone but the underlying goal is to produce top quality software that is meeting the business objectives for what it is being built and be easily understood, maintained and evolved by a software development team at a fraction of the time usually required to achieve production-grade software.. 

Thanks to the **high flexibility** of its artifact generation engine, the project can be easily tailored to suit any programming language or any architecture/framework chosen by the architect.

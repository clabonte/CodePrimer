-- TODO: This SQL will not execute as-is. You will need to generate a strong password and
--       replace <replace_with_strong_password> with your password, surrounded by '
--       You will also need to set this password in the right environment variable and/or file (e.g. .env.local)
-- HINT: You can generate a strong password using an online tool such as: https://passwordsgenerator.net/

-- NOTE: As per MySQL specifications (https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/creating-accounts.html):
--       The '{{ package|user }}'@'localhost' account is necessary if there is an anonymous-user account for localhost.
--       Without the '{{ package|user }}'@'localhost' account, that anonymous-user account takes precedence when
--       {{ package|user }} connects from the local host and {{ package|user }} is treated as an anonymous user.

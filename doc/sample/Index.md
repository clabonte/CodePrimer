# CodePrimer - Sample Application
There is nothing like a sample application to understand a new tool/framework for any developer.

How about a nice little *Hello World* ?? 

Sorry, no *Hello World* here... This is **way too simple** given CodePrimer's complexity.

In order to fully understand how CodePrimer can **really help software architects and senior developers**, we need to understand their reality and mimic a real-life scenario.

## Scenario
Let's pretend you are teaming up with **business partners** and, together, you came up with a great application idea: 
> Create a **revolutionary blogging platform where authors can make money with articles they publish based on their popularity**. 

We will call this novel application **Channel**. 

With your 10+ years experience in software development, you are well-versed in multiple programming languages, frameworks and approaches.
As such, you know there are **several ways to design and implement** this application based on the business needs, expectations and skills available in the development team.

Your credentials are what allowed you to join this group as their **techie guy**... 
When **discussing with your business partners, they don't understand** much of what you say... you might as well speak Chinese to them! 
However, **they value your expertise and fully trust you** to make the right choices **to build a successful software-based business.**
 
Everyone is excited and confident that **Channel will be the next big thing!** 
Since you are not at your first gig, you expect your business partners, **especially the sales and marketing folks**, to often change their mind along the way and **pivot their business model**, as they say, a few times before getting it right.   

To top it off, your business partners are all excited about this **MVP (Minimum Viable Product) concept** they came across in the latest best-selling business book they bought...
Even if you agree with the concept, you have a different view of the *minimum* and *viable* parts of the MVP equation than your partners. 
 - Your partners focus on the *minimum feature-set* required to **sell** *a viable product*. 
 - You worry about the *minimum feature-set* required to **support** *a viable product* **in production**.

Knowing that 20% of the effort spent when creating an application is on the implementation and 80% on its maintenance, you understand that it is **equally important** to **doing the right things** (*your partner's MVP vision*) as **doing things right** (*your MVP vision*).

However, those two aspects are usually conflicting from a technological point of view.
 - On one hand, if you go too fast, you may end up with a botched prototype deployed in production. This may cause irrevocable harm on the confidence of all stakeholders.
 - On the other hand, a fully robust solution may take too long to build for the market/funds available and/or lack the flexibility to adapt to quickly changing needs.

Even if there are very good patterns available out there, solving this dilemma adequately is where the best software architects really shine. 
 
OK, now that your vision and plan are well defined, you and your partners are ready to move forward with confidence with the next step. 

*Or are you??*

> Who is going to implement your vision and execute on your plan to deliver the first version in the unrealistic timelines expected by your partners?

**If you have a strong team of senior developers, you are blessed and may not need CodePrimer!** 

Otherwise, keep reading, as your worst nightmare is about to begin...

You need either to:
 - **Find, train and retain good developers** in a short period with a limited budget or,
 - **Hire an external firm** with a good sales pitch but, under the hood, is packed with 10 mediocre developers for each decent one on board. Oh, and that decent guy, is actually allocated to 3 other projects and must train the 10 sloppy developers at the same time.
 - **Sub-contract the development altogether** to a 3rd party firm and, cross your fingers they know their stuff... Only to realize, too late in the process, that they are not better than option 2.  

Regardless of the option chosen, **this is now your problem** and you end up spending most of your time managing people rather than ensuring **developers are doing things right**.

*Sounds familiar?*

Sorry for the digression... Let's get back to our great application idea!

The **following sections will explain how CodePrimer can help you** design the application's business layer in order to come up with a flexible, [production-grade](../ProductionGrade.ml) solution that **will support the expected growth with minimum cost and overhead on your part.**

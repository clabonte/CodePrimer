## Planned Artifacts
CodePrimer's vision is to allow architects and senior developers to model business backends in a programming language and framework agnostic approach in order to:
- Focus discussions and design at the business level to ease communication with their business partners
- Quickly adapt/iterate their design with minimal impact on implementation
- **Prime** the development of the application using **production-grade** practices for properly guide other developers in the right direction

At some point in time, we need to turn our beautiful design in actual source code and, for that, we need to select the programming language and frameworks based on our needs, desire and experience.
**CodePrimer has been designed to easily generate its various artifacts using any programming language and framework**.

### Planned Artifacts
Based on the current roadmap, the following artifacts will be added to CodePrimer in the near future:
